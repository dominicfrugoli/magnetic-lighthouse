## About The Project

The Magnetic Lighthouse is a Pure Data patch that was built as part of an exhibiton with some other students at Columbia College Chicago. It is meant to emulate a pulsar star with lots of chorus and amplitude modulation. Check out the [project page on my website](https://www.dominicfrugoli.com/magnetic-lighthouse) to hear the audio from the exhibition.

This repository holds the Pure Data patch, so feel free to take a look.
